# OSX Memory Editing: Elixir + Rust edition!

This project has a collection of Rust toy applications that do a simple thing, and Elixir + Rust (via rustler) apps, that tweak that functionality by injecting into the running program and writing to its memory.

Elixir apps can be found in `osx_memory_ex/apps` and Rust toy apps can be found in `toy_programs/` - each toy program has corresponding Elixir applications that modify it

This repository mainly serves as a reference - a starting point from which to jump into the world of Memory Editing MacOS applications.

It can be a fun way to see a collaboration between Rust and Elixir!
